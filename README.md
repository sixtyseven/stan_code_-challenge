## scripts

React 19 migh not work well with the testing library, I used ` npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass the issue for this test.

`install: npm run install`
`dev: npm run vit`
`lint: npm run lint`
`test: npm run test`
`build: npm run build`

Preview the built codes. Build command needs to be run before the preview command.
`preview: npm run preview`

## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

1. 2D Navigations can be implemented
1. I will try to make the UI looks better and the animation smoother.
1. I might add storybook
1. More unit tests can be added to test more cases
